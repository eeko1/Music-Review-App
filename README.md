# 🎵 Music Review App

I created this **Music Review App** as part of my studies during "Uudet Teknologiat" course. It was built using **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and **CSS**, with **Chart.js** for data visualization and **Supabase** as the backend.

## 🚀 Features

Users can post reviews of their favorite albums and rate them on a scale of 1 to 10. They can also explore reviews from others, discover new music, and get inspired to check out different albums. Additionally, users have the ability to edit or delete their reviews and view insights, such as who has written the most reviews.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Vue.js** – Frontend framework
